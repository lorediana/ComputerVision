# Homework 1

Write a Python function similar to the function gaussian_fourier_filter provided during lab 2 tutorial at point 20 which will apply homomorphic 
filtering in frequency domain. The function will receive as parameters: the cut-off frequency D0, the high frequency gain gamma_H, the low frequency gain gamma_L, 
and the input image.

In main.py we can find the requested function homomorphic_filter that applies the specified instructions to an input image.
